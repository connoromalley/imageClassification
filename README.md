This is a proof of concept for an app I may expand on in the future. The finished product will accept user photos of animal footprints and identify the animal with a percentage confidence level.

Current barriers are accessing large amounts of animal track data which may be possible using the inaturalist API. 

Currently the program identifies dog vs deer tracks very well. With good training data, I believe many other species can be identifiable as well.

More work on this project to come.
